OCIAM Thesis for LyX - readme
------------------------------

These files form a LyX skeleton structure for the OCIAM Thesis class by Keith A. Gillow <gillow@maths.ox.ac.uk>, which is available online at http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/help/faqs/latex/thesisclass. Here, I have modified the class file slightly and transposed it into a version that plays nicely with LyX.

I give no license to do anything with it, warranty or guarantee that it will work. Use at your own risk. Enjoy responsibly. Oxford's "visual identity" is legally protected, the logo is a trademark, and they have very specific branding rules, which can be found at http://www.ox.ac.uk/branding_toolkit/. That's all the issues I can think of, so onto installation...

Installation
-------------

Firstly, you'll need to have a working copy of LaTeX and LyX. Next

1. Copy the ociamthesis-lyx.cls into your LaTex installation directory
2. Refresh your TeX installation so it finds the new file
3. Copy the ociamthesis-lyx.layout file into your LyX userdir layouts directory
4. Open LyX and run the 'reconfigure' command.
5. Restart LyX and you should be ready to go.

The steps will vary depending on your operating system and LaTeX setup. For example, for me on my Mac:
1. Copy over the ociamthesis-lyx.cls to
	 /Users/danny/Library/texmf/tex/latex
2. From the terminal run 
	 sudo texhash
3. Copy over the ociamthesis-lyx.layout to
	 /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/LyX-1.6/layouts
4. Go to menu LyX > reconfigure
5. Restart and you'll be ready

You'll have to do the tinkering yourself if you're on Windows or Linux!

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

As nobody has actually ever asked me a question about this, here's a few questions I thought might come up:

Q. How do I change the logo on the titlepage to my university?
A. First, get a copy of your logo in PDF format, preferably square, and put it into titlepage/mylogo.pdf. Then, go into Document > settings > Latex preamble and change the line:
	\def\crest{{\includegraphics{titlepage/beltcrest.pdf}}}
to point to your new logo file. 

Q. Where is my LyX user directory?
A. The location of the LyX user directory depends upon the system LyX is installed on. Some common locations are below.
    * Linux and other Unix-like systems: usually found at ~/.lyx, where ~ is your home directory.
    * Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/LyX-<VERSION>/
    * Windows Vista / Windows 7: usually at C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\lyx<VERSION>\ (note: this is if you installed LyX for all users)
(from http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/UserDir)

Q. What are the main differences between the ociamthesis-lyx.cls and the original one?
A. I've edited the ociamthesis.cls and removed all the metafont definitions because from experience they complicate things -- and hey, who uses metafonts nowadays? I also moved the titlepage logo definition to the document preamble. I felt these changes made it a derivative so appended -lyx to the filename.

Q. Is there an equivalent ociamthesis.cls for Humanities?
A. Yes, there is a latex class out there: S. Evans has modified the ociamthesis.cls to make it conform to the regulations for Humanities. This can be found online at http://samuelevansresearch.org/main/2010/05/oxford-thesis-latex-template/. He's added a definition to ociamthesis.cls called 'frontpages' which adds a few necessary bells and whistles.
